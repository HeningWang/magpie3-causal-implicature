# magpie3-causal-implicature

[Magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/) experiment for a simple experiment into "clausal implicatures", i.e., inferring causal information where none was explicitly conveyed.

This is version **Pilot 02c**. This version was similar to 2b, but asked not to reproduce the initial message by the earlier colonists (recall), but rather to just inform the next generation.
This seems to have had the effect that more 'eagerly advisory' reproductions were given. But the experiment was still troubled by the earlier technical problems (weird missing data, double allocations).

Live version of the experiment [here](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie3-causal-implicature/experiments/pilot-02b).
