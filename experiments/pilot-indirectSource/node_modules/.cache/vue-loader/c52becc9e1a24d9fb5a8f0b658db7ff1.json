Their survival depends on a rare plant known as <strong>Xeliherb</strong>, a life-sustaining resource native to the planet. This unique plant has extraordinary properties, providing essential nutrients necessary for survival on the planet. Furthermore, it holds potential as a key ingredient in medicines capable of curing diseases, which has attracted significant interest from scientists around the galaxy.</p>\n\n      <p>However, xeliherb grows only <strong>sparsely</strong>, and its limited availability has made life on Xelifan-3 a constant struggle.</p>\n\n      <button @click=\"$magpie.nextScreen();\">Next</button>\n    </Screen>\n    <Screen :key=\"i\">\n          <!-- ************************************ -->\n           <!-- ************************************ -->\n           <Slide v-if=\"trial.F2_listenerRole === 'scientist'\">\n            <p>\n            You are one of the <strong>scientists</strong>, part of an elite team tasked with uncovering the secrets of <strong>Xeliherb.</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Your mission centers on deep exploration of Xeliherb’s properties, with the hope of unlocking its potential for humanity’s future. Each piece of data and sample collected offers new insights into how Xeliherb grows, and what methods might increase its yield over time. From your remote research station, you analyze information sent by the colonists, using scientific expertise to develop techniques that may enhance Xeliherb’s growth and sustainability.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            However, there is sometimes tension between scientists and colonists.
