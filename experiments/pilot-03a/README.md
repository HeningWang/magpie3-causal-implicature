# magpie3-causal-implicature

This repository contains several [Magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/) experiments design to investigate "clausal implicatures", i.e., cases where interpreters infer causal information where none was explicitly conveyed.

There are several kinds of (pilot) experiments here (see `experiments` folder):

- *Pilot 1*: forced choice + justification of that forced-choice decision
  + pilots 1a and 1b differ only in the formulation of the background scenario (pilot 1b contains information that 'ralocrop' is costly to cultivate)
- *Pilot 2*: forced choice + justification + reproduction
  + pilot 2a: similar to 1b, but with slightly rephrased instructions; also includes additional reproduction task
    - N=33, more reproduction with 'causal language' when participants chose to cultivate both crops
  + pilot 2b & c: similar to 2a, but with actual iterated narration chains; unfortunately, flawed by insufficient understanding of participants regarding what to reproduce
