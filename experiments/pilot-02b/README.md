# magpie3-causal-implicature

[Magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/) experiment for a simple experiment into "clausal implicatures", i.e., inferring causal information where none was explicitly conveyed.

This is version **Pilot 02b**. This version was a genuine dynamic (iterated) experiment.

There were some issues, though:

1. Three runs only submitted partial data (prolific_pids %in% c("62b0d20142d2ad90afb8ba9b", "614b11e399369a0d52b5fbf6", "604fa685e33606f9a0ee8189"))
2. There were double allocations to the same variant-chain-generation triple.
3. The reproductions were all very direct "recall" statements. The summary / helpfulness character of the reproductions from Pilot 2a seems to have been lost.
